# Python-database-connection
In this project, i show how to connect to databases using anaconda python. 
The python version that i am using is 3.6.1.
modules used are pyodbc, pandas, and cx_oracle
The version of your python and odbc drivers should be the same
The version of python and oracle client should also be the same in order to connect to oracle databsae

# For the SQL server example
"Trusted_Connection=Yes" specifies that a user account is used to establish this connection.
