# Python-database-connection
In this project, i show how to connect to databases using python pandas and pyodbc. 
The python version that i am using is 3.6.1.
The versi of python and odbc driver should be the same, 
i.e. if you have a 64bit python installation, your sybase driver should also be 64bit.
